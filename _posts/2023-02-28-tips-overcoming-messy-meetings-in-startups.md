# Tips to overcome messy meetings in a startup



I have spent the first years of my career in a startup that had quite some messy meetings. From these years, I will share you some tips on how to structure meetings effectively in order to increase productivity and ensure that everyone leaves feeling motivated and accomplished :)

One of the biggest problems with meetings in a startup is that they tend to be very unstructured. People talk without an agenda, repeating every point and discussion that has taken place in the past. This can be frustrating for everyone involved and can lead to a lack of motivation and interest in attending meetings.

Before calling for a meeting, consider whether or not it's truly necessary. A general rule of thumb is to only call for a meeting when you need creativity, such as for brainstorming sessions or when you're stuck on a specific problem.

When you do send out a meeting invite, be sure to establish a clear agenda and send it out to all participants beforehand. This allows everyone to come prepared and stay focused during the meeting. During the meeting, be sure to stick to the agenda and keep the discussion on track. If someone brings up a topic that is not on the agenda, politely redirect the conversation back to the current topic or suggest that it be added to the agenda for the next or another meeting.

Another important aspect of structuring meetings is to establish clear roles and responsibilities for each participant. This helps to ensure that everyone knows what they're responsible for and that tasks are assigned to the appropriate person. It also helps to prevent confusion and misunderstandings, which can lead to wasted time and frustration. If there are participants where their role for the meeting is not clear, it might be better to leave them out (and tell them so, so they will know you value their time!).

Lastly, it's important to keep track of action items and follow up on them after the meeting, as most of the times, action items end up to be forgotten. Assign tasks to the appropriate people and establish deadlines for completion. Follow up with participants to ensure that tasks are completed on time and that progress is being made.

Tip: while you are driving the meeting, a tip would be to jot down the action items and focus on providing as much context as possible, while neglecting the grammar of it. Then, you can put these comments into a large language model such as ChatGPT and ask it to for example "summarize this meeting transcript, group the action items by participant". There is simply no time to make notes beautiful yourself, so why not make use of some advanced techology instead!


## Take home
- Especially in startup environments, meetings are mostly unstructured and more frustrating
- Determine that each participant has a role to play in the meeting. If not, leave them out.
- Stick to the agenda, send out beforehand, and keep it within time limits.
- Create dirty but extensive notes, so later on you can put them in a large language model to get them structured.
- Send out a summary + action points, potentially set a reminder for follow-ups.
